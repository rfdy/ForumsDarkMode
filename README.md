## Installation
The easiest way to get setup is to use the [Stylish extension](https://userstyles.org/) with your browser of choice. Once you've installed Stylish, you can [install the dark mode stylesheet from userstyles.org directly](https://userstyles.org/styles/132648/redflagdeals-com-forums-dark-mode). You can also use the Stylish file in this repository.

The original CSS file upon which the Stylish file is based is also provided, if you wish to use a different method of applying the dark mode style.

## Support
We at RedFlagDeals are offering this stylesheet as-is, with no guarantee of support. That said, you are free to take a copy of the stylesheet (or fork this repository) and modify it to your heart's content.
